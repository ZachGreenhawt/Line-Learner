DON: This is a crazy script.
LEO: It really is, we should keep rehearsing.
ALEXA: Guys, we are going to be late to class if we don't stop
DON: So what? We're already failing, you failed your SAT, and Kaeleigh's on us about this show,
all I see are reasons to rehearse.
ALEXA: Don't bring up my SAT again.
LEO: Guys, please stop.
